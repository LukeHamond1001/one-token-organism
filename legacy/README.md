> **The first lineage.** This folder holds the 297M one-token organism of 2026-08/09 (its model code in `legacy/iga`, its raising program and pod scripts in `legacy/scripts`, its plans and results in `legacy/docs`), kept as it was. Paths below are relative to `legacy/`; run its scripts from inside `legacy/`. The living project is the body from nothing: see the root README, `body/`, `tools/`, `BODY_SPEC.md`, `DIARY_BODY.md`.

# Vision — the one-token organism

A 297M-parameter language creature that lives in **one continuous
stream** and **learns while you talk to it** — on a single MacBook.
No context window tricks, no retrieval, no serve-side scripting:
every word on screen is sampled from the model, and every decision
about what to learn, when to sleep, and what to feel proud of comes
from the model's own measured signals.

```
you: how does a submarine work?
it : I do not know that yet, but you could teach me.
you: a submarine dives by filling its tanks with water and rises
     by pushing the water back out.
you: so how does a submarine work?             (next morning)
it : A submarine dives by filling its tanks with water and rises
     by pushing the water back out.
```

## The body — `iga/lm_scan.py`

| Organ | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Trunk** | 13-layer selective-scan recurrence, d=1024 — O(1) memory per token |
| **Council** | six timescale bands (clocks 1 → 32k tokens): syntax up to the shape of the day |
| **PFC** | routing and silent thought tokens |
| **Hippocampus** | episodic store: surprise-gated writes, decode-free logit-space reads, carries across days with nightly decay |
| **Plan / dreamer** | imagined futures scored on foresight; REM splices two memories at a scene cut |
| **BG · DA** | reward as experience: graded press tokens felt in-stream through real value/dopamine circuitry |
| **Goal organ** | wake-surviving pursuit slots read in identity space (lesion-verified) |

## The life — `scripts/organism.py`

**Day** — it measures its own surprise every turn and keeps what
spikes (budgeted); the caretaker's expression reaches it as a sense (a press level
riding the next word) whenever it changes, in either turn; the dose
follows reward surprise — the face minus what its value heads expected
— and lands on the words spoken into it; every wake dose rehearses an
old memory beside the new one; mood clears in minutes; a reply that
runs long is nudged to breathe; when its answer to something
it learned satisfies its own conscience, it presses its own button —
felt only, never self-teaching. **Night** — its own progress ledger
picks the replay (mastery graduates, stuck fades, fresh always
settles, nothing drills more than two nights running); dreams pair
the memories that moved it most (its own surprise, the peak of its
internal reward while they were lived, its conscience, its mood); the conscience retrains on
the human's real presses; mastered facts enter an expanding
retention schedule (1/3/7/14/30 nights). **Always** — mood, built
from felt presses and its own measured surprise, feeds back into
how it thinks. The life autosaves every night and survives process
death.

Every threshold, budget, schedule, and reflex is a plain number in
the code (the disclosed genome), shown on screen as it acts. The
serve never authors a word and never parses the human's text for
meaning.

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukeHamond1001/one-token-organism.git && cd Vision
pip install -e .          # torch, tokenizers, numpy
# weights (the living body + tokenizer, ~1.2G):
#   https://huggingface.co/Luke1001/one-token-organism
# put organism_life.pt and ship_tok.json in data/, then:
python3 scripts/organism.py data/organism_life.pt data/ship_tok.json \
    --dev mps --temp 0.05 --save data/organism_life.pt
# open http://localhost:8016 — talk to it. The number beside the text
# box is your expression (−6…6), felt with what you say. Its reply
# comes one token per Enter under your current number; the face each
# word was spoken into is that word's reward. Sleep it at night.
```

First reply after launch takes a few minutes (the model compiles);
after that it answers in seconds. Works on Apple Silicon (`--dev
mps`), CUDA (`--dev cuda`), or CPU (slow). What has been measured
about it: [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md).

## Tools

`scripts/birth.py` — a fresh life from the birth body (the gestated
weights, no facts, day 0): everything it will know, it learns live ·
`scripts/opus_caretaker.py` — Claude Opus raises it itself, from
scratch: no gold list, no rule for the face; Opus decides what to teach,
says it in the creature's register, holds a face over every word of the
reply by its own judgment of meaning, answers back, sleeps it, checks
the morning, keeps a diary (credentials from your environment) ·
`scripts/caretaker.py` — the rule-based teacher at the same protocol: asks word by word, holds a face over every token of the reply
against the gold (still while right, −2 at the first wrong word, praise
once the answer lands), teaches back with a smile, sleeps it, checks the
morning; `--opus` lets Claude Opus paraphrase the asks and judge
gold-less replies ·
`scripts/mini_school.py` — balanced interleaved consolidation over
everything it knows (the periodic deep sleep) ·
`scripts/stutter_repair.py` — targeted unlikelihood on a degenerate
token loop, with a golds-abort gate · `scripts/knowledge_school.py`
— bulk knowledge raising · `scripts/goal_gym.py` — frozen-body
training of the goal organ · `scripts/critic_train.py` — conscience
seeding · `scripts/scan_chat.py` — terminal REPL · `pod_*.sh` /
`launch_pod.sh` — GPU gestation infrastructure for the next scale ·
`iga/lm_train.py` + `iga/lm_data_life.py` — the gestation method
itself (day/night-structured lives with rewards in-stream, the diet
the body was born on and the recipe the next body scales).

## The diary body

[DIARY_BODY.md](DIARY_BODY.md): two writers, one page, one symbol at a
time on a shared clock; no turns, no end marks, silence is a symbol it
must choose. The model has a speaker channel and a letter-level memory
that fades in silence; the serve is next.

## The body from nothing

A 0.5B conceived at random weights (`scripts/conceive.py`), its own
real-English vocabulary, content-keyed memory that recalls by mechanism,
raised only by live days. LIVE_BODY.md §9 says what to expect and why;
§10 lists every constant and reflex the running body uses (an independent
no-cheats audit, 2026-09-01).

```bash
python3 scripts/conceive.py data/organism_life_blank_0p5b.pt data/tok_0p5b.json --d 1024 --n-layers 29 --content-keys
python3 scripts/organism.py data/organism_life_blank_0p5b.pt data/tok_0p5b.json --dev mps --temp 0.05 \
    --save data/organism_life_blank_0p5b.pt --pursuit-adopt 0.45 --pursuit-target 0.3 --port 8016 --max-new 28 \
    --store-read-beta 1.0 --store-boost 16 --store-boost-min 0.15 --live-lr 1e-6 --store-decay 0.9 --hush-ent 0.9 --hush-mem 0.06
```

## The live body

[LIVE_BODY.md](LIVE_BODY.md) — the 0.5B organism that learns only from
faces: your face as a continuous sense on every token, its face as a
forecast of yours taught at every token, dose by surprise with
eligibility traces, online value learning, the cost of speaking
(cortisol), and the build status of each organ.

## The next body

[GESTATION.md](GESTATION.md) — the v17 pretraining method: the
organism's food is lives, not documents. `scripts/author_lives.py`
writes the childhoods (every rule measured on this organism by its
teachers); `iga/lm_data_life` turns them into lane shards;
`iga/lm_train` gestates 32+ childhoods at once through one body,
against a matched transformer control on identical food.

## Honest limits

At 297M, question→answer routing shares narrow capacity: heavy
drilling or repeated corrections can collapse it (the school pass
restores balance), abstract inference does not emerge, and social
statement replies are thin. The conscience is young — it learns the
human's taste a few presses per night. These are measured size
limits, not serve tricks; the development history lives in the git
log.
