"""A62 Phase 1 — consolidation ("sleep") on the certified substrate.

Wake is the v9.4 loop unchanged. Sleep replays ONLY paid episodes:
drive ledger entries with pay > 0 name token spans [t0, t1]
(token-denominated, A60d), sliced from a rolling per-lane buffer of
the exact tokens each lane streamed — the same mechanism serves the
synthetic weaver and tokens.bin shards, and a resume starts the
buffer at drive.step_t so ledger times stay aligned.

Mechanism arms (winner frozen after the debug A/B, A55b culture):
  ARM A  replay-training — paid spans re-fed as LM chunks with store
         reads OFF: the trunk alone must learn to predict the paid
         material (consolidation as payment-selected curriculum).
  ARM B  store->trunk distillation — trunk-alone logits trained
         toward trunk+store logits (KL) on the same spans. The
         teacher writes the span into a fresh store copy as it
         replays, so its later chunks carry the associative bonus;
         sleep funds exactly what LM loss defunds (the A61 null
         margin, predicted at A55c). In logit-store mode reads touch
         only the logits, so teacher and student hiddens — and hence
         band/store states — are identical; one shared state serves
         both passes exactly.
  ARM C  contrastive pair replay (A68) — the negative channel the
         A67-P8 laws demanded: CE-only replay cannot encode "not"
         (negation is exposure; "X not Y" poisons X's own stem). A
         negative press marks the utterance it lands on as WRONG;
         the next positive press within a gap marks the caregiver's
         correction as RIGHT; the pair replays under a bounded
         margin loss softplus(-beta*(logp_right - logp_wrong)) over
         UTTERANCE tokens only. The wrong tokens appear solely as
         suppression targets — never CE targets — and both member
         presses leave the CE-span economy entirely. With no pairs
         minted, ARM C is bit-identical to ARM A by construction.

Laws (pinned at A62, enforced here, tested in test_lm_ladder):
  L1 only-paid-replays — every replayed window lies inside a ledger
     entry's span with pay > 0; provenance kept, audit() checks it.
  L2 parity-off — train(sleep=None) runs zero sleep code; a dose-0
     Sleeper (every=0) buffers but never fires and consumes no
     torch RNG, so baseline training reproduces bit-exactly.
  L3 slow-weights-only — sleep updates trunk/band slow weights;
     store and aux head are frozen (requires_grad off -> grad stays
     None; AdamW skips them, weight decay included).
  L4 no drive pay — sleep never touches the drive: no probes, no
     sweeps, no ledger writes; telescoping untouched.

Replay runs on FRESH state (wake band/store state is never advanced
or disturbed) in eval mode — deterministic, no read-dropout or
XL-dropout draws — using the sleeper's own python RNG, so a sleep
block leaves the wake torch RNG stream untouched: dose > 0 differs
from baseline only through the weight updates. Sleep steps ride the
wake optimizer at the current wake lr (the cosine schedule
reasserts lr on the next wake step).

        8.8k tok/s). Now the scan starts at the first press that
        can still touch the buffer window and voids per lane. A
        span survives the final filter only if t1 >= start +
        MIN_REPLAY, and a negative can only void a span minted by
        an EARLIER press (t < its own t + T), so nothing before
