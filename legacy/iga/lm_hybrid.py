"""v5.4 — the complete architecture as an LLM (A19 + A24).

Attention is the hands, the bands are the memory, imagination is the
lookahead, the ledger is the law.

Substrate: a standard decoder-only transformer over each 512-token
window (language, in-window lookup). Riding above it: slow band
latents at clocks 512 / 4096 / 32768 — persistent across the whole
run, injected back as MEMORY TOKENS the transformer attends over.

v5.4 (A24, from the run-4 autopsy): the v5.3 bands were written with
the MEAN of all window hiddens each tick — an unforecastable soup;
fid:4/5 sat below floor all run, the gate vetoed every cross-window
frontier, and the real carry transient died unpaid. Now:
  selective read — each band attention-pools the window with its own
    learned query (it chooses what to look at, not everything);
  closed-by-default write — an exposed-gate slow cell, update gate
    biased shut at init, so the state drifts slowly and the band's
    forward model has something learnable to predict;
  write cost — a small penalty on open gates keeps writes sparse.

Same forward API: (tokens, st, _) -> (logits, st, ticks). Lesion
zeroes the memory tokens. The trainer reads model.pop_write_cost().
