"""v5.0 drive layer on the endless dialogue — full architecture, no scenes.

Laws, unchanged in substance (card A6):
  labels select, the world pays — a human "thanks" (the earned event)
    MINTS the channel it followed; pay comes only from measured
    readings graded against text the model cannot edit.
  no hold outlives its referent — every hold carries a horizon set by
    its band's clock; at the horizon it settles on the readings that
    arrived, or expires at exactly zero. No brackets needed.
  telescoping — pay = w*(phi_open - phi_settle), float64 bookkeeping,
    exact by construction; a hold that ends where it opened pays zero.
  imagination ranks and vetoes, never pays — a frontier target whose
    carrying band cannot currently predict its own next window is
    vetoed as unreachable; low fast-band fidelity vetoes on health.

Channels:
  recall:b<bin> — p(answer token) at annotated probes, binned by gap.
  fid:<k>       — band-k next-window cosine fidelity at ticks.

The scheduler: bin_weights() biases the weaver toward gap bins showing
learning progress — the drive layer choosing what rides the belt.
