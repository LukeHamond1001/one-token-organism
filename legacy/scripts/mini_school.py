"""Mini-school (49yy): balanced interleaved re-grounding of the LIVE
body's router. The week's serial serve plasticity (concentrated
pursuit replay + stacked corrective unlikelihood) collapsed the
question->answer router onto single attractors while storage stayed
intact (the 49ss dissociation). The 49rr remedy applied to a living
body: every fact it knows -- session facts, old facts, its own noticed
statements, the innate golds, idk forms -- shuffled flat, small even
doses, no fact favored. School for balance; live for top-up.

Usage: mini_school.py data/organism_life.pt data/ship_tok.json \
