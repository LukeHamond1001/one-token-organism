"""The one-token organism (2026-08-21, the user's design).

The cortex sees ONLY the token that just arrived. Nothing before it
reaches the trunk except through the organs:

  PFC = the bands — a clocked ladder of recurrent states (band 3 ticks
        every token: the working memory of the last few words; bands
        4..K on the ladder in TOKENS), offered to the trunk as attended
        memory slots at every layer (keys/values only — the deep blocks
        transform the token slot alone, which keeps the cost near a
        plain transformer's);
  hippocampus = the content-keyed identity store (LogitStore), whose
        read enters as its own slot AND adds to the logits (the exact
        recall path).

Between tokens the whole COUNCIL — the token's hidden, the store read,
every band — talks through a shallow exchange (full attention among the
slots); each band's write is gated by its own gate and by VETOES from
the other bands; the council's token slot speaks.

Per token t (batched over lanes), order="cortex_first" (the brain's
order: input -> sensory cortex conditioned top-down by PFC -> PFC ->
decision):
    e_t     = embed(x_t)
    c_t     = trunk(e_t | slots [m_3..m_K, r_t])
    S'_t    = council([c_t, r_t, m_3..m_K])
    logits_t = head(lnf(c'_t)) + alpha-weighted store read of q(c'_t)
    r_{t+1} = store_in(read_t)                  the hippocampus slot
    band k, every clock_k tokens: pooled = mean of its council slot
        over the interval; h_k <- (1-g)h_k + g tanh(W[h_k; pooled]),
        g = sigmoid(z) * prod_{j!=k}(1 - veto_{j->k});
        pend_k = pred_k(h_k); fid_k = cos(pend_k(prev), pooled_C - mu_k)
        (the band listens to its council slot; it predicts the cortex
        stream C pooled over its interval, centred per band)
order="pfc_first" (the user's design, ratified 2026-08-21: all input
goes into the PFC; the PFC outputs one bundle of embeddings; the rest
of the neocortex makes the decision): the council (PFC) runs on the
raw embedding with the band and hippocampus slots, the bands write,
and the trunk (neocortex) queries with the council's token slot over
the WHOLE council bundle S'_t as its key/value slots at every layer —
it never sees e_t directly.

Precision law (the user's: bf16 for the neocortex, 32 bit for the
PFC): only the trunk blocks run under bf16 autocast; the council, the
cells, the vetoes, the predictors, the band states, the store, the head
and the loss are fp32 in both orders.

Store writes once per chunk (T tokens): key_t = proj(c'_{t-1}), value
= identity of x_t, the A38 two-pass credit unchanged; reads see the
previous chunks' M — the bands carry the current chunk. Credit: full
backprop through every state within the chunk; across the boundary
the last write of every band and its pend ride as cloned-parameter
graphs on detached inputs (the A38 pattern), as does the store's one
write-op.

Same forward API as HybridLM: (tokens, st, _) -> (logits, st, ticks);
lesioned / store_read_off / mem_off mean the same things. Clocks are
in TOKENS (clock_unit = "token"); horizons = clock.
